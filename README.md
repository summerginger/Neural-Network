# Neural-Network
19.2.4

According to the accuracy metric, the basic single-neuron, single-layer neural network model was only able to correctly classify 89% of all data points in the nonlinear training data. Depending on a person's use case, 89% accuracy could be sufficient for a first-pass model. For example, if we were trying to use a neural network model to separate left-handed people from right-handed people, a model that is correct 89% of the time is very accurate, and guessing incorrectly does not have a huge negative impact.
However, in many industrial and medical use cases, a model's classification accuracy must exceed 95% or even 99%. In these cases, we wouldn't be satisfied with the basic single-neuron, single-layer neural network model, and we would have to design a more robust neural network. 

In summary, the more complicated and nonlinear the dataset, the more components we'd need to add to a neural network to achieve our desired performance.
